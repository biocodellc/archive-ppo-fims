# Plant Phenology Website
The ppo-fims repository stores the codebase for the plantphenology.org website running at http://www.plantphenology.org/.  This repository is similar to other FIMS instances (e.g. geomedb, arms, biscicol) but instead of relying on user-uploaded spreadsheets, the processing and loading of data files is done outside of this instance, using, for now the code and instructions running under the https://github.com/jdeck88/pheno_paper repository.
