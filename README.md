The BiSciCol FIMS (Field Information Management System) is a working instance of the Biocode FIMS software stack.  The BiSciCol FIMS utilizes a Triplestore data storage engine and is the first created instance of the [Biocode FIMS](https://github.com/biocodellc/biocode-fims-commons/) stack.  It is based on earlier validation software created for the Moorea Biocode Project and utilizes the following workflow: Validation -> Ingestion -> Triplification.  A working installation is at http://biscicol.org/ .
